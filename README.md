## **Inspiration**

I used to refer a lot of documents and I was facing disorganization issue with the documents. then I did some research regarding this issue and find out many of my friends and teachers suffer with same issues. Then I started refering to multiple solution for this problems. And found out this one practical implementation.

## Problem Statment : 
Too Many Documents under a single directory not only confuses the user, but it is also a time consuming job for a User to find a particular file at very efficient time. Documents needs to be settled at a specific address from where it can be extracted easily.

## **What it does**
That classifies the document into various classes according to its content. Currently available Classes are Art, Science & Technology, Finance, Government & Politics, and Health. It analyses and handles the documents on a large scale. This type of algorithms can be utilised by operating systems to make workspace more managable.

## **How we built it**
Using React, we have built web-app to provide user interface and collect documents. Then using flask, we have built server to actually use the ML model on data. After it will transfer documents from web-app to server. We will extract features from documents and pass it to ML model and then it will generate category output.

## **Challenges we ran into**
It was really got messy, when we started implementing server. But make it out of it.

## **What we learned**
While building a project, we should always consider its scalability in the future. though it does raise several privacy issues, with a serving mindset, we can always use it for the greater good.
